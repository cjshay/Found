Notes
- try to see if I can render the info I want without using jbuilder (seems verbose?)
- make tests so that when I change something, I know nothing is breaking


questions
- what is being passed into app
- how does the whole children thing work in React
- what is the point of app/ what is it's purpose?
- how do I pass my png images into the react component
- how do I get my nav bar to always stay central
- how do I select the different signins without going into ids
- Is my heroku database connected to my local database?
- if I update how the heroku database works, will I have to clear everything?
- how can I push to the router when I didn't import router
- why do we send back a function to this.update?

Cool solutions
- responses are stories
  - nested comments in comments in comments
- stories are in the index route so the detail page is housed
  within that (don't need to do an ajax call)

to do
- reset the state if needed- make sure the wrong stories don't end up in the
wrong places
- do css for index page
  -correct small issues
  - (size story container if needed)
    - based on title, text in textarea
    - and picture etc
- do css for comments (a link if you want to comment)
- user show page (upload and show it on stories)
- upload photo when make a story and show on show page
- insert/ upload main show page picture
- styling
  - cursor pointer on likes
  - fill in heart when liking



less important
- guest dropdown menu
- display date
- create story show page
  - write a story links to show page
- pretty text editor and rendering
- make sure that nested comments render correctly

issues
- create comment doesn't display after refresh

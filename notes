- try to see if I can render the info I want without using jbuilder (seems verbose?)
- make tests so that when I change something, I know nothing is breaking


questions
- what is being passed into app
- how does the whole children thing work in React
- what is the point of app/ what is it's purpose?
- how do I pass my png images into the react component
- how do I get my nav bar to always stay central
- how do I select the different signins without going into ids
- Is my heroku database connected to my local database?
- if I update how the heroku database works, will I have to clear everything?
